# Interactive Data Visualization Tutorials with p5.js
This is a repository for *interactive data visualization* tutorials using the p5.js library. Written by Juan Francisco Saldarriaga at the Center for Spatial Research, 2018.

The following tutorials are available:
* [Setup a localhost and create a basic webpage](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/dataviz_tutorials/blob/master/01_SetupLocalHostBasicWeb.md)
* [Basic JavaScript syntax](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/dataviz_tutorials/blob/master/02_IntroToJavascript.md)
* [Introduction to p5.js](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/dataviz_tutorials/blob/master/03_IntroToP5.md)
* [Loading data and creating a basic chart with p5.js](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/dataviz_tutorials/blob/master/04_WorkingWithData_p5js.md)
* [Adding interactive elements to a p5.js sketch](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/dataviz_tutorials/blob/master/05_Interactivity.md)
* [Querying APIs with p5.js](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/dataviz_tutorials/blob/master/06_QueryingAPIs.md)

Write a couple of paragraphs that talk about the intention of these tutorials, and how they fit into our way of working 'critical data'.
