# Interactive Data Visualization Tutorials with p5.js
This is the repository for the *Interactive Data Visualization* tutorials by the [Center for Spatial Research](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).

The idea behind these tutorials is to provide the Columbia University community, and the public at large, with a series of short, basic instructions, on how to visualize data on the web. These tutorials cover web basics (`Localhosts`, `HTML` and `CSS`) and the beginnings of programming (`JavaScript`). They use mainly the `p5.js` library for `JavaScript`, due to its clarity, ease of use, and great support community and documentation.

Through these tutorials we don't strive for completeness or depth. Instead, we seek to present a clear starting point, from which people can begin building their visualization skills and engaging with data in a responsible and transparent manner. For more references and materials on data visualization see our [Introduction to Data Visualization for Architecture, Urbanism and the Humanities](https://github.com/juanfrans-courses/dataViz_arch_hum) course repository.
